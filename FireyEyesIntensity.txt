The best way to focus for me is to hold firey eyes, intensity, and passionately engage to
internalize the knowledge!!!

Awesome and you have been doing this the last few days so keep it up and you can see your

Always remeber and use the firey eyes and intensity and this will help you focus like a MOFO!!!


Fire eyes and stoic face will aid you work an study with passion!!!
