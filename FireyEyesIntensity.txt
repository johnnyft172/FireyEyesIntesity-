The best way to focus for me is to hold firey eyes, intensity, and passionately engage to
internalize the knowledge!!!

Awesome and you have been doing this the last few days so keep it up and you can see your
are actually enjoying your study session and having more productive study session as well!

Always remember and use the firey eyes and intensity and this will help you focus like a MOFO!!!


Fire eyes and stoic face will aide your work and study with passion as this helps recruit the soul = HEART!!! ❤️💜💛 Remember FIRE EYES are the windows / GATEWAY to the SOUL!!!!
